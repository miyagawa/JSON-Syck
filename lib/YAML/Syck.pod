=head1 NAME 

YAML::Syck - Fast, lightweight YAML loader and dumper

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.10 of YAML::Syck, released
January 9, 2005.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use YAML::Syck;

    $data = Load($yaml);
    $yaml = Dump($data);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface to the B<libsyck> data serialization
library.  It exports the C<Dump> and C<Load> functions for converting
Perl data structures to YAML strings, and the other way around.

=head1 CAVEATS

The current implementation bundles libsyck source code; if your system has a
side-wide shared libsyck, it will I<not> be used.

This module is not currently pluggable to the new L<YAML> (0.50+) framework,
but that's expected to change in the future.

Dumping cyclic references is currently broken.
